A large site or e-commerce platform can take 8-12 weeks. We provide you with an exact timeline after the initial analysis."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my site be unavailable during migration?",
          "answer": "No! Your current site remains fully functional throughout the entire process. We develop the new site on a staging server and test it completely before launch. The transition from old to new site happens instantly, usually taking only a few minutes for DNS propagation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens to my SEO ranking?",
          "answer": "SEO is our priority! We implement 301 redirects for all old URLs, retain all meta tags, structured data and optimize technical SEO. In most cases, clients see improved SEO rankings after migration due to better performance and Core Web Vitals. We offer 90-day SEO monitoring after launch."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I keep my current design?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! You can choose between three options: (1) Identical transfer - we keep the current design pixel-perfect, (2) Refresh - we keep the structure but modernize elements, or (3) Complete redesign - we create a new modern design. Most clients choose option 2 for the best balance."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does migration cost?",
          "answer": "The price depends on the scope of work. Small sites start from €1,500, medium sites €3,000-€6,000, and large complex projects or e-commerce can be €8,000+. We offer a free estimate after analyzing your site. Payment is divided into several phases (deposit, milestones, final payment)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I update the site after migration?",
          "answer": "Yes! We can integrate a headless CMS like Sanity, Contentful or Strapi that allows you to easily update content like in WordPress. Alternatively, we offer maintenance packages where we do updates for you. We also provide video tutorials and documentation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens to images and video files?",
          "answer": "All media is migrated and automatically optimized. The Next.js Image component automatically compresses images, generates responsive versions and serves them in modern formats (WebP, AVIF). Video files can be hosted on your server or migrated to cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3) for better performance."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I retain control over the domain?",
          "answer": "Completely! You retain ownership of the domain. We only update DNS records to point to the new server. You can use any domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, CloudFlare, etc.). We'll help you with DNS configuration and SSL certificate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I find a bug after launch?",
          "answer": "We offer 30 days of free post-launch support. All bugs and issues that occur during this period will be fixed at no additional cost. After that, you can choose between hourly support or a monthly maintenance package."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I keep my blog and existing posts?",
          "answer": "Of course! All blog posts, categories, tags and comments will be migrated. We can integrate a CMS for easy future blog posts, or implement a Markdown-based blog system. URL structure can remain the same for SEO (/blog/post-name) or be optimized."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will my forms and integrations work?",
          "answer": "Yes! We migrate all contact forms, newsletter subscription forms, payment integrations, CRM connections (HubSpot, Salesforce), email marketing (Mailchimp), analytics (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) and all other third-party services you use."
