    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "faq1": {
        "question": "How often should content be posted on Facebook and Instagram?",
        "answer": "We recommend a minimum of 3-5 times weekly on Facebook and 4-7 times weekly on Instagram (including Stories). Consistency is key - it's better to regularly post quality content than sporadically post large amounts. Instagram Reels and Stories can be used more frequently as they have a shorter lifespan."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "How long does it take to see results on social media?",
        "answer": "First visible results (follower growth, increased engagement) usually come after 1-3 months of consistent work. More significant results such as increased conversions and sales come after 3-6 months. Social media marketing is a marathon, not a sprint - it takes time to build an engaged community and establish a brand."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "Is a budget needed for paid advertising?",
        "answer": "While it's possible to achieve results with organic content, paid advertising significantly accelerates growth. Organic reach on Facebook and Instagram has drastically declined (usually 1-6% of your followers see an organic post). We recommend a monthly advertising budget of minimum €100-200 for small businesses, €300-500 for medium and €500+ for large businesses."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "What's the difference between organic and paid content?",
        "answer": "Organic content is everything you post without paying - it's visible to your followers and may appear in Explore/Discover sections. Paid content (ads) allows you to target a specific audience that may not follow your profile but matches your buyer persona. Best results come from combining both approaches."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "Can I manage my social media myself?",
        "answer": "You can, but professional management requires significant time, creative skills (design, copywriting, video editing), knowledge of algorithms, advertising platforms, analytics tools and constant trend tracking. Most business owners don't have the time or resources for quality social media management while running their business. We have a team of specialists and tools that guarantee results."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "How do you measure success on social media?",
        "answer": "We track multiple metrics: follower growth, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares, saves), reach and impressions, click-through rate (CTR), website traffic from social media, lead generation, conversions and ROI on advertising campaigns. We focus on metrics that directly impact your business, not just vanity metrics."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "Do you work with other platforms besides Facebook and Instagram?",
        "answer": "Our primary specialization is Facebook and Instagram as these are the most used platforms in Serbia and the region with the greatest potential for most businesses. These two platforms cover a wide spectrum of demographic groups and industries. For specific needs, we can consider other platforms in consultation with the client."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the content?",
        "answer": "Before each post, we send you the content for approval. You have the option to request changes and adjustments until you're completely satisfied. We do revisions until the content is perfect. Also, after the first month of collaboration, we learn your brand and communication tone, resulting in content that fully matches your vision."
