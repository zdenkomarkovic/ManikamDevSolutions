      "q1": {
        "question": "What budget is needed for a Google Ads campaign?",
        "answer": "The minimum recommended monthly budget depends on industry and competition, but generally starts from 300-500 EUR per month. For more competitive areas, 1000+ EUR may be needed to see significant results. During consultation, we analyze your industry and competition to provide an accurate estimate of the optimal budget."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How quickly can I see results?",
        "answer": "First results (clicks and traffic) are visible immediately after launching the campaign. However, for optimal performance and best ROI, 2-3 months of continuous work and optimization are needed. The Google algorithm learns about your campaign over time, resulting in better performance and lower cost per click."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Do you only do setup or also campaign management?",
        "answer": "We offer both options - we can just do the initial campaign setup, or you can engage our team for continuous management, optimization and monthly reports. Most clients choose full management as it delivers the best results. Our team regularly monitors performance and adjusts strategy for maximum ROI."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What if the campaign doesn't deliver results?",
        "answer": "We work transparently and provide realistic estimates. If after the initial period we see that results are not satisfactory, we analyze the reasons together and adjust the strategy or budget. Our goal is always maximum ROI for your budget."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What types of Google Ads campaigns do you do?",
        "answer": "We do all types of Google Ads campaigns: Search campaigns for search, Display campaigns for visual advertising, Shopping campaigns for e-commerce, Video campaigns on YouTube, and App campaigns for mobile applications. We choose the best combination according to your goals and budget."

      "q6": {
        "question": "Do I need to have a Google Ads account?",
        "answer": "You don't need to have an existing Google Ads account. We can create a new account for you or work with your existing account."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "How do you measure campaign success?",
