      "title": "Why Your Business Needs Custom Software?",
      "paragraph1": "Off-the-shelf software solutions often don't cover the specific needs of your business. You might need 80% of functionality but have no use for the other 20%, or you're missing that key feature that makes the difference. <strong>Custom software is designed exactly for your business processes</strong> - you get what you need, without unnecessary features you pay expensive monthly subscriptions for.",
      "paragraph2": "In the digital age, <strong>business process automation is not a luxury - it's a necessity for competitiveness</strong>. Every manual process your employees perform can be automated. Instead of your people spending time on repetitive tasks, custom software works for you 24/7, without errors, faster and cheaper. One good CRM system can replace 10 Excel sheets and reduce order processing time from 30 minutes to 30 seconds.",
      "paragraph3": "<strong>Average return on investment (ROI) on custom software is 300-500% in the first 2 years.</strong> After initial development, you spend minimally on maintenance, while ready-made solutions charge monthly/annual subscriptions that pile up. Custom software is your property forever, you can integrate it with any system and scale as your business grows. You don't depend on external providers who can increase prices or shut down the service."

          "point1": "<strong>Generic features</strong> - much of it you don't need",

          "point3": "<strong>No ownership</strong> - dependency on provider",
          "point4": "<strong>Limited integrations</strong> - only what they support",
          "point5": "<strong>Charged per user</strong> - more expensive with growth",
          "point6": "<strong>Same tool as competition</strong> - no differentiation",
          "point7": "<strong>Slow processes</strong> - you adapt to their workflow",
          "point8": "<strong>Your data on their servers</strong> - privacy concerns"
        }

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "faq1": {
        "question": "How much does custom software development cost?",
        "answer": "The price depends on project complexity, number of features and development time. Simple web applications start from $5,000-10,000, medium complexity systems (CRM, ERP) from $15,000-30,000, while complex enterprise systems can cost $50,000+. It's important to note this is a one-time investment - after that you only pay maintenance (~10-15% annually of initial price). For comparison, SaaS solutions cost you $1,000-5,000 annually and these costs pile up endlessly."
      },
      "faq2": {
        "question": "How long does custom software development take?",
        "answer": "Time depends on project scope. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version can be ready in 2-3 months. Medium complexity projects take 4-6 months, while complex enterprise systems can take 6-12+ months. We use Agile methodology, so you get functional versions every 2-3 weeks instead of waiting months for the final product."
      },
      "faq3": {
        "question": "Can I see progress during development?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! We work in 2-3 week sprints. At the end of each sprint you get a demo of functional software version, you can test, give feedback and together we define priorities for the next sprint. You have access to project management tool (Jira, Trello) where you track progress in real-time. We also have regular meetings (weekly/bi-weekly) where we discuss progress."
      },
      "faq4": {
        "question": "What if I want to add new features later?",
        "answer": "That's one of the biggest advantages of custom software! As your business grows and changes, you can add new features. We create software with modular architecture that allows easy expansion. You can order development as needed (hourly/daily rate) or arrange a retainer for continuous support and development. You're not limited like with SaaS solutions where you have to wait for the provider to add a feature (if they ever do)."
      },
      "faq5": {
        "question": "Who will own the source code?",
        "answer": "You! After final payment, the complete source code becomes your intellectual property. You get full ownership of the software and can do whatever you want - give it to another developer for maintenance, sell it, license it, etc. This is a big difference compared to SaaS solutions where you never own the software."
      },
      "faq6": {
        "question": "Do you offer maintenance and support after launch?",
        "answer": "Yes. We offer different support packages - from basic support (bug fixes, security updates) to full-service package (bug fixes, updates, new features, 24/7 monitoring). We usually charge 10-15% of initial software price annually for continuous support. You can also choose whether you want monthly retainer or pay-as-you-go model where you only pay as needed."
      },
      "faq7": {
        "question": "What if I have an existing system that needs integration?",
        "answer": "We specialize in integrations! We can integrate new software with your existing systems - accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero), CRM, ERP, e-commerce platforms, payment gateways, shipping APIs, email services and any system that has an API. We can also create an API for your new software so other systems can connect to it."
      },
      "faq8": {
        "question": "Can I see your project portfolio?",
        "answer": "Due to NDA agreements with clients, we cannot publicly showcase all projects. However, we can organize a call where we'll show you case studies of similar projects, share references from satisfied clients and demonstrate our expertise. Many of our clients are willing to share their experience with potential clients."
      },
      "faq9": {
        "question": "What happens if I'm not satisfied during development?",
        "answer": "Our Agile approach minimizes this risk because you constantly get feedback and control over the project. We do payments in milestones (e.g. 30% start, 30% after MVP, 30% after beta, 10% finalization), so you only pay when you see results. If you're not satisfied, we do revisions until you are. We have a satisfaction guarantee - if functionality doesn't work as specified, we fix it at no additional charge."
      }
    }
  }
